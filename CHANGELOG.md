# Changelog

## [1.0.0] — 2026-07-28

First release, extracted from the [adonis7-base](https://github.com/JantStack/adonis7-base)
chassis where the engine was developed, hardened and security-audited.

### Added

- `AuthorizationDriver` contract with executable semantics: hierarchical
  scopes (downward-only inheritance), explicit denies that win, observable
  expiry, polymorphic holders, deny-by-default reads and idempotent writes.
- `database` driver — self-contained, engine-agnostic SQL over `authz_*`.
- `openfga` driver — facts in an OpenFGA server, expiry via FGA conditions;
  catalog and hierarchy stay local.
- Executable contract suite published at `@jantstack/adonis-authz/testing`
  so custom drivers are judged by the same cases.
- `configure` hook publishing the migration and both config files, plus
  `appAccess` middleware, provider, and the `openfga:provision` /
  `openfga:import` commands.
- Idempotent catalog sync with role `rank` metadata for consumer-side
  assignment policies.

### Security

- Scope keys are validated in the openfga driver: a type or uuid containing
  the separator could make two distinct scopes collide into one binding id,
  letting a grant in one scope authorize in another. The `database` driver is
  immune by construction (type and uuid live in separate columns).
- Catalog slugs are validated (no `~` or `|`) for the same reason.
- Reads fail closed: an errored deny check counts as denied, and batched
  checks verify completeness before granting.
